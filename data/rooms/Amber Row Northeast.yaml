descriptions:
    see:
        - "Atop a handful of hills in the valley, Amber Row enjoys the best view of the city. The best sunsets and generally pleasant temperatures make housing in Amber Row pricey, but beautiful. A small number of well-dressed Arcans and their mata stride on their way."
    smell:
        - "The wild grass and vegetation of the valley grow virulently in this area."
    feel:
        - "The sun glints over the valley wall, warm and inviting."
