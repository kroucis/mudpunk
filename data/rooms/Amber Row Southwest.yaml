    see:
        - "Atop a handful of hills in the valley, Amber Row enjoys the best view of the city. The best sunsets and generally pleasant temperatures make housing in Amber Row pricey, but beautiful. A breathtaking view of the city unfolds in the valley below. The tightly clustered houses and shops tell the tale of rapid and wanton expansion."
    hear:
        - "Neighbors hail each other in passing, and the clank of their mata echo off the close valley wall."
