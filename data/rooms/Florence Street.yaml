        - 'Abustle with fellow Arcans, Florence Street opens to a wide cobblestone avenue, lined with various businesses and vendor carts. The buildings here are wrapped in pipes, tubing, and machinery. Even over the street the pipes stretch from building to building, creating a sort of surreal metallic tunnel.'
